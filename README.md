# Small Book Image Dataset

This is a dataset of book images, but number of samples are small.

This is created for a blog post. Please refer to it for the detail.

## How you can run the code

1. Run `download.sh` to get externally dependent python codes.
2. Run Jupyter notebooks.

## Jupyter Notebooks

- `Small Dataset -Ttrain With Augmentation.ipynb` - You can simply run this only. This has the best model.
- `Small Dataset -Ttrain Without Augmentation.ipynb` - What if we don't use augmentation? Check this.
- `Dataset examples.ipynb` - For making dataset examples. You won't need this.
